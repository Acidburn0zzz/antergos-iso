CNCHI TODO LIST (11 Mar 2013)

* General:
 - Check all file paths (os.path.join)

* Language screen:
 - We need to have the full locale like "es_ES" in order to set the
/etc/locale.conf file. In the language screen we just get "es"

* Installer_advanced screen:
 - If you play with the partitioner (create partition, delete it, create it
   again, delete it again...) in the end it gets confused.

* Timezone screen:
 - Add NTP switch

* Keyboard screen:
 - Doesn't sort words that have accents (arcnexus fixed it, needs testing)

* Slide screen:
 - Not all the installer events (messages) are shown. pac.py generates
   too many messages

* installer-thread.py file:
 - create_fstab needs testing.
 - Copy the skel directory directly instead of every folder in it
